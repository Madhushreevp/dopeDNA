# 01_Understanding  ${\color{aqua} 'Python'}$ 
##### Objective :- The ground plan is to understand and learn ${\color{aqua} Python}$ in a simpler manner.
### 01. Introduction :
* Programming is a way to instruct computer to perform various tasks.
* Why Python?
* Simple to use
* Easy to understand 
* Free  and  open source 
* Works on Windows/ MAC / Linux OS

### 02. Basic Data :
* No semicolon neeeded in Python.
* Module :
  - file having code
  - written by someone else
  - can be imported,used in our program
  - can be **Built-in** (pre installed in python)
  - can be **External** (need to be installed in python)
  - <code style="color : black">pip install *module_name</code>* : command for installing module
  - <code style="color : black">pip install *playsound </code>*  :  command for playing sound in python using module
* REPL : 
  - **read evaluate print loop**
  - works in terminal
  - can't save program in REPL 
  - used for faster evaluation
 
 ### 03. Key Info :
 * Comments :
   - lines of code 
   - want to write 
   - but don't want to execute
   - written for better understanding 
   - <code style="color : black"># single line comments</code> : used for single line comments
   - <code style="color : black">'''multi-line comments'''</code> : used for multi-line comments
   - ''' more than 1 line string ''' is called string literal 
        -  Note : <code style="color : black">os.listdir()</code> : used for listing all files in directory
     
 * Datatypes :
   - variable is name to any memory location
   1. integers 
   2. floating point
   3. string
   4. boolean 
   5. None 
   - in python, string can be in single or double or triple quotes
   - in python, datatype is identified by itself 
   -  in python, datatype name can start with letters, underscore but not with digits & space
   -  same rule applies for identifer (identifier is class or function or variable name )
   - in python,   <code style="color : black"> type(variable) </code>  is a built-in function which returns datatype of any variable
